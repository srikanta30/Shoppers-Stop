### How To Use âœ…

First you have to have to go to the signup page and create a new account. Then you will be redirected to the OTP page, where you will get a random OTP in alert message. Use that to complete the signup process. After the signup process is completed you have to login with the same details. You can now go to the category page and navigate to add products to the cart. After that you can proceed to the checkout page. If you are not signed in you will be redirected to the signin page where you should use the same details you used during the signup proces. After signin you can go to the checkout page and add your address and proceed to payment page to add your debit/credit card detials to place your order successfully.
